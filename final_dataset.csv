Machine Learning Engineer,Vendasta Technology (India) Private Limited,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu",Chennai,"Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without explicit programming. It focuses on developing algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions. Essentially, machine learning allows computers to learn from experience, just like humans do, by adjusting their behavior based on the data they are exposed to. Here's a more detailed explanation: Core Concepts: Learning from Data:Machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets to identify patterns and relationships within the data. No Explicit Programming:Unlike traditional programming, where you tell the computer exactly what to do, ML algorithms learn from data and adapt their behavior. Prediction and Decision Making:The goal of ML is to enable systems to make accurate predictions or decisions based on the patterns they have learned. Adaptability and Improvement:As ML models are exposed to more data, they can improve their performance and become more accurate over time. Types of Machine Learning: Supervised Learning:Algorithms are trained on labeled data, where the desired output is provided for each input. Unsupervised Learning:Algorithms work with unlabeled data and try to find hidden patterns or structures within the data. Reinforcement Learning:Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for their actions.
